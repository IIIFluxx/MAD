Assumptions:
	- City name has no effect on game - just aesthetic
	- Settings have restrictions on how many digits/letters can be put in by user (e.g. Map W/H, Initial money has a set limit - you can only assign so much money).
	
These assumptions are made from the Specification and how I prefer my game to flow (whilst still abiding by the spec).
